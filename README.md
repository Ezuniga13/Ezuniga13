### Hi there, I'm Esteban Zuniga ğŸ‘‹
I am a former Math tutor turned Data/Analytics Engineer. I like jazz music, classic films and am bit of a foodie.


   I have a passion for building data driven apps that provide insight and are interactive . <br/>
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an animated dashboard using Dash to build it and Docker to productionize it!
